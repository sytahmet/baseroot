# Backend API Unit and Integration Tests (Simulated)

"""
This file will contain simulated unit and integration tests for the FastAPI backend APIs.
Due to the environment limitations (no live database, no live Solana network/contracts, no live IPFS/Arweave, no live LLM for complex AI tasks),
these tests will primarily focus on:
1.  Endpoint reachability and basic request/response validation (correct status codes, expected response structure for happy paths with mocked data).
2.  Validation of input Pydantic models for some common error cases.

These are NOT comprehensive tests and do NOT verify actual database operations, smart contract interactions, or complex AI logic.
The user will be provided with guidance on how to set up a full local environment for more thorough testing.

"""
To run these (once a main.py or equivalent app setup is done for TestClient):
1. Create a main.py in the baseroot_backend directory that instantiates FastAPI and includes all routers.
   Example main.py:
   ----------------
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from baseroot_backend.auth_api import router as auth_router
   from baseroot_backend.nft_api import router as nft_router
   from baseroot_backend.dao_api import router as dao_router
   from baseroot_backend.ai_discovery_api import router as ai_router

   app = FastAPI(title="Baseroot Backend")

   app.include_router(auth_router)
   app.include_router(nft_router)
   app.include_router(dao_router)
   app.include_router(ai_router)

   @app.get("/")
   async def root():
       return {"message": "Welcome to Baseroot Backend API"}
   ----------------

2. Install pytest: pip install pytest
3. Navigate to the directory containing this test file (e.g., baseroot_backend/tests)
4. Run: pytest test_api_simulated.py (or just `pytest` if in the root of tests)

Note: The current test file itself creates a dummy `app` for TestClient, so it can be run directly if placed correctly relative to the API route files.
For a more structured project, tests would typically be in a `tests` directory and import the main `app` object.
